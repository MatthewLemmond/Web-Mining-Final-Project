This project is for ITIS 4510 at UNC Charlotte for Prof. Wenwen Dou. The project seeks to do some basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on tweet data, as well as some higher level analysis like sentiment analysis.

The main library being used for this project is the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) which is standard in the NLP world. The project also uses standard data science libraries such as pandas to give us a nice data structure for our data.
